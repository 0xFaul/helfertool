==================
Create a new event
==================

When creating a new event or editing and existing event there are a lot of
options. Here is a description of some to these:

Name for URL:
    This is the name used in the URL for the registration.

    Example: if the name for the URL is *testevent* then the registration is
    available under http://helfen.fs.tum.de/testevent.

    .. warning::
        You should not change this value after the registration was opened or
        you sent a link to someone.

Event name:
    This is the displayed name of the event, you can change it whenever you
    want.

E-Mail:
    This mail address is used as sender of the confirmation mails.
    It is possible that some people response to these mails when they want to
    contact you. So you should make sure that mails sent to this address are
    read.

    Additionally a mail is sent to this address if someone gives a wrong mail
    address in the registration form or the confirmation mail cannot be
    delivered for some other reason. But this should not happen too often.

Logo:
    This image is displayed on top of the registration form.

    Please use a reasonable image size!
    The image is not scaled down automatically at the moment.
    A width of 400 px should be really enough!

Admins:
    These people can edit the complete event (and also delete it, including
    all registrations!).

    When you create a new event you will be set as admin automatically.

Registration possible:
    The event is visible publicly.

    .. note::
        The registration over links is possible even when this is not set.

Helpers have to confirm to be full age:
    There is a checkbox in the registration form for this. If someone does not
    click it he cannot register.
