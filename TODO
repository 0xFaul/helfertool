* delete event logo (the file)
* add errors to all forms

* badges
  * shift (name for each shift, time,...?)
  * delete_badge{permission, role, design}
  * for some jobs an upload of an image is possible
  * Background images optional, color instead
  * configure path to pdflatex in settings
  * timeout and other protection for subprocess call
  * Image for responsibles? (option)

* mails: custom sender

After ESP
=========

* Datetimepickers for shift
  * begin < end
  * change end when begin is changed
* change password, forgot password
* search username with name and mail
* add helper: infection_instruction only when necessary
* delete event: delete badge upload directory
* pdf export: vertical alignment
* remove old uploaded files in media directory
* latex_template: validation for .tex
* copy event with job, shifts, settings, badge stuff but without admins and helpers
* add ical file to confirmation mail
