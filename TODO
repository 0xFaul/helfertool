* atomic validation if shift is full
* Load Test (deactivate mail!)
* bot protection

* add helper to more shifts

* PDF export: hide shirts

* badges
  * shift (name for each shift, time,...?)
  * for some jobs an upload of an image is possible
  * delete_badge{permission, role, design}
  * delete primary_job if helper is deleted from shift
  * do not print badge if its not the primary job

* job admin can see t-shirt size table of their job

Low priority
============

* all vs. distinct
* set width of table columns
* Mail: link to registered page
* Search helper (name, mail)
* modelform: mark optional fields
* sort helpers and coordinators
* delete event logo (the file)
* add errors to all forms

* badges
  * Background images optional, color instead
  * configure path to pdflatex in settings
  * timeout and other protection for subprocess call
  * Image for responsibles? (option)

* mails: custom sender

After ESP
=========

* T-Shirts fixieren
* ask for preferred language on registration
* order of jobs
* delete helper as job admin: cannot select other shifts
* Javascript translation with Django
* Number of helpers in shift: negative number can be selected, validation only on save
* Datetimepickers for shift
  * begin < end
  * change end when begin is changed
* change password, forgot password
* search username with name and mail
* add helper: infection_instruction only when necessary
* delete event: delete badge upload directory
* pdf export: vertical alignment
* remove old uploaded files in media directory
* latex_template: validation for .tex
* copy event with job, shifts, settings, badge stuff but without admins and helpers
